# Chronos installer
This installer is for the Chronos project ([Github](https://github.com/alexlegarnd/Chronos)) but it can be used to install other software.
This installer is developed in Pascal Object (Delphi) because it's a language that allows you to quickly develop.

## Dependences

Delphi Libraries: 
- JEDI Code Library 3.3 (From GitIt package manager)

DLLs:
- 7z.dll (from [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/))
- OpenSSL dlls (can be downloaded [here](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries))

## Build
Just open the project with Delphi. The Community Edition is free for personal use.
It use ActiveX for desktop and start menu link so I don't know if it can be compiled with Lazarus.
